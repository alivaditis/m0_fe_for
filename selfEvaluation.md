# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?
  
4 out of 5

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? 
Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

It built my confidence that I could research methods and operators that hadn't been explicitly explained.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I need to continue to practice more advanced loop to get the syntax memorized.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

Does the placement of the if statement within the codeblock effect the execution?  I will do some googling.
